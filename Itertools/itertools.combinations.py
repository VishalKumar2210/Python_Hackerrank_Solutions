from itertools import combinations

word, length = input().split()
for i in range(1, int(length) + 1):
    for j in combinations(sorted(word), i):
        print(''.join(j))

# Steps used in solving the problem -
# Step 1: First we imported combinations from itertools.
# Step 2: then, we have taken the input of word and length.
# Step 3: After this, we created a for loop in the range of 1 to (length+1).
# Step 4: Inside for loop, we created another for loop and used the "combinations" method to make combinations
# and the "sorted" method to sort these combinations alphabetically.
# Step 5: In the last step, we used the join method and printed our combinations.
