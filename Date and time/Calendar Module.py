import calendar
month, day, year = list(map(int,input().split()))
ans = calendar.weekday(year, month, day)
print((calendar.day_name[ans]).upper())


# Steps Used in solving the problem -
# Step 1: First we imported the calendar.
# Step 2: In the second step we have taken the input of month, day, and year.
# Step 3: then calendar.weekday to get the weekday of our input.
# Step 4: At last we used the calendar.day_name to get the day name of our weekday.
