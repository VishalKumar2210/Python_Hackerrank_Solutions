import cmath

n = input()
s = complex(n)
print(abs(s))
print(cmath.phase(s))

# Steps Used in solving the problem -
# Step 1: First we imported cmath.
# Step 2: then we have taken the input of n.
# Step 3: and we have defined n as a complex number.
# Step 4: At last we used the abs function to print the absolute value of s
# and cmath.phase to print the phase value of s.
